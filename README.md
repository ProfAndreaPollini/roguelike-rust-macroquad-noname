Roguelike Game in Rust using macroquad.rs

Introduction
Welcome to our roguelike game developed in Rust! This project aims to provide an engaging gaming experience while also allowing developers to learn and explore Rust programming. The game is built using the powerful macroquad.rs library and follows the guidelines of the "RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial." Join us live on my Twitch channel and be a part of the development process with the support of our vibrant community!

## Features

- Turn-based gameplay: Experience the classic roguelike mechanics where the game progresses in turns.
- Procedurally generated levels: Each game session offers a unique and challenging dungeon layout.
- Randomized items and enemies: Encounter a variety of items and foes as you delve deeper into the depths.
- Permadeath: Be cautious! Once your character dies, the game ends, and you must start anew.
- Fog of War: Explore the dungeon one step at a time, revealing the map as you go.
- Tile graphics: I'using the amazing [urizen_onebit tileset]([Title](https://vurmux.itch.io/urizen-onebit-tileset))
